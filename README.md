# chrome-extension
Hackathon 1

In Today's world, we are constantly stressed and overwhelmed. We have probably 20 tabs in our browsers on the daily and are constantly multitasking,
trying to keep up with all the information from news to articles about our field to keeping up with those long conversations from friends that we don't really want to read right away. That is why we created Synthia- a non gender Binary Screen Reader that does the readying for you so you can multitask through your other tabs. Synthia comes in over 50 different languages and is not responsible for what she says. 
We used Speech Synthesis API to develop a Chrome Extension geared towards individuals looking to increase their productivity fourfold. You can listen to research at up to 3x the speed and have multiple threads running simultaneously(if you can bear it).
